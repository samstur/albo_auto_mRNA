# Workflow/pipeline details for the albopictus autogeny RNA-seq analysis

## Upstream 
Information about sequence reads (raw read count, read alignment rate, etc.) for the data can be found in the following google sheets: ([link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_RixzDGNsUlvhOMVCTXViuR_Rim8dNrS5joLMOwbsXo/edit#gid=0))

### Data Accession
Data was generated at Georgetown by Mara, Peter, and Sam.

The raw reads are available in NCBIâ€™s short read archive (SRA) under accession number XXXXYYYY

### Preprocessing and Quality Control
Trimmomatic (version 0.39) was used to trim sequence reads based on quality ([script](https://github.com/samstur/albo_auto_mRNA/blob/main/trim.sh))

FastQC (v0.11.9) was used for quality control visualization ([script](https://github.com/samstur/albo_auto_mRNA/blob/main/fastqc.sh))

### Mapping
We will be mapping with STAR (v2.7.1a).

Mapping was done using our lab's newest Aedes albopictus reference genome (aedes_albopictus_AalbF3.fa) and the corresponding annotation file (aedes_albopictus_AalbF3.gff3)

STAR (v2.7.1a) was used for indexing the genome ([script](https://github.com/samstur/albo_auto_mRNA/blob/main/STAR_genomeIndex.sh))

Reads were mapped in a two pass method. The first pass followed typical method with splice junctions from annotations ([script](https://github.com/samstur/albo_auto_mRNA/blob/main/STAR_mapping.sh)). The second pass is similar except that it additionally uses the output splice junctions info from the first pass (these would be novel splice junctions) to facilitate mapping ([script](https://github.com/samstur/albo_auto_mRNA/blob/main/STAR_map_twopass.sh)).

Output sam files were converted to bam and then indexed ([script](https://github.com/samstur/albo_auto_mRNA/blob/main/sam2bam.sh))

### HTSeq Gene Counts
HTSeq (v0.13.5) was used to counts reads mapped to genes for downstream analyses ([script](https://github.com/samstur/albo_auto_mRNA/blob/main/htseq_count.sh)). The following line in linux was run on each of the output HTSeqCount files to calculate the totle number of reads assigned to genes by HTSeq (sum the number of read counts across genes for each sample):
sed -n '1,22193p ' 10H_S11_htseqCount | awk '{print $2}' | awk '{Total=Total+$1} END{print "Total is: " Total}'

# Downstream analysis of gene counts using R (v4.3.2)

### DESeq2 (v1.34.0) package in R was used to identify differentially expressed genes
([script](https://github.com/samstur/albo_auto_mRNA/blob/main/DESeq_script.R))

### KEGGREST (v1.34.0) package in R was used to identify significantly enriched pathways
([script](https://github.com/samstur/albo_auto_mRNA/blob/main/KEGG_Enrichment.R))
